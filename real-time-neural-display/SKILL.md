# Real-Time Neural Field Visualizer

## 1. The "Always-Alive" Normalization Framework
To prevent "flickering" or "blackouts" in real-time brain data, you MUST use a stabilized dynamic range:
- **Dynamic Percentiles**: Every frame, calculate `p99.9` (vmax) and `p0.1` (vmin) of the active neural field.
- **EMA Stabilization**: Apply an Exponential Moving Average (alpha=0.15) to these limits: `v_stab = (0.15 * v_current) + (0.85 * v_prev)`. This ensures the color intensity "breathes" rather than flashes.

## 2. Spatial Mapping & Weighting
- **Gaussian Kernel**: Map sensor data to cortical meshes using `weights = exp(-dist**2 / (2 * sigma**2))`. For high-fidelity EEG, use `sigma=0.12`.
- **Mesh Subset**: Stride your surface mesh (e.g., fsLR) by `[::15]` to maintain real-time responsiveness without losing topographic detail.

## 3. Connectivity Aesthetics (Broadband Flow)
- **The Electric Graph**: Connect nodes with streamlines. Line `alpha` and `linewidth` must be proportional to the average activation of the connected nodes.
- **Colors**: Use high-contrast pairings (e.g., `Magma` heatmap with `Cyan (#00f2ff)` electric streamlines).
- **Dual-Layer Halo**: Apply a scatter layer with `s=350` (Primary) and `s=600` (Glow/Halo) at `alpha=0.3` to simulate cortical depth.

## 4. Clinical State Indicators
- **The Halo Alert**: Implement a state-aware boundary. When a biomarker threshold is hit, shift the boundary halo to high-intensity Red (`#ff0000`) with `alpha=0.5` and `linewidth=10`.

## Context / scope of the new skill
General framework for real-time brain data viz (EEG/fMRI).

## Instructions
Use EMA limits and Gaussian weights to ensure "Always-Alive" fluidity.

## Technical Crap
Requires Nilearn, Matplotlib, and PIL.
